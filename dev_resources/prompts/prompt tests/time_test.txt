## Example 1: Getting the current time

In this example, we will learn how to get the current time using the time module in Python.

```python
import time

current_time = time.time()

print("Current Time:", current_time)
```

## Example 2: Converting timestamp to a structured time

In this example, we will learn how to convert a timestamp to a structured time using the time module in Python.

```python
import time

timestamp = 1628698080

structured_time = time.gmtime(timestamp)

print("Structured Time:", structured_time)
```

## Example 3: Formatting the current time as a string

In this example, we'll learn how to use the time module in Python to display the current time in human-readable format.

```python
import time

current_time = time.localtime()

formatted_time = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", current_time)

print("Current Time Formatted:", formatted_time)
```

## Example 4: Sleeping (pausing) for a specified amount of time

In this example, we will learn how to use the time module in Python to add a delay in the execution of our program.

```python
import time

print("Start")

time.sleep(5)  # Number of seconds to pause the execution

print("End")
```

## Example 5: Measuring the execution time of a Python code

In this example, we will learn how to use the time module in Python to measure the time taken to execute a Python code.

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()

# Your code here
result = 0
for i in range(1000000):
    result += i

end_time = time.time()

print("Execution Time:", end_time - start_time)
```
